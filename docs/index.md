# UNO AI agent Algorithm

This website explains
- the Project and Game we targeted
- The algorithm design
- Our results and next step

# Hardware requirements
Minimum System Requirements:

- CPU: Modern multi-core processor (Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 equivalent or better)
- RAM: 4 GB minimum, 8 GB recommended
- Storage: ~500 MB for Python dependencies and project files
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux with Python 3.7+

# Motivation

As part of our AI class requirements, we needed to solve a non-trivial sequential decision problem. We chose UNO because it’s engaging and presents several technical challenges that align with core AI concepts such as:

- sequential decision making
- partial observability
- A Complex state space

The Game was fun to build and tested our understanding of the concepts we learned
